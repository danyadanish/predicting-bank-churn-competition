* Performed EDA on the dataset to determine relationships and correlations between attributes. 
* Cleaned data using many popular techniques such as outlier removal, one-hot encoding, label encoding, normalization, and standardization. 
* Attempted to predict the target label once using Logistic Regression, then Decision Trees, and finally Random Forests.
* Compared model performance and visualized our findings.
